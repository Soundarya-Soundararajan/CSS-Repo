    <h3>How It Works?</h3>
    <p>Organic agriculture, whuch is governed by strict government standards, requires that products bearing the organic label are produced without the<br>
    use of toxic and persistent pesticides and synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, antibiotics, synthectic hormones, genetic engineering or other excluded<br>
    practices, sewage sludge, or irradiation.</p>
